Conan the Deployer has set up your project.

Next, set up your deployment:

* Edit config/servers.json to specify your stages, servers, and roles

* Edit the TODOs in deploy/chef/dna/*.json

* Add stage-/role-/server-specific files in deploy/chef/dna/*.json

* Add some post-deployment tests in test/deploy/smoke_test.rb that test the
  deployed app.

* Add your own recipes to deploy/chef/recipes/site-cookbooks

Finally, use Capistrano to configure your servers and deploy your application
to the desired stage:

* cap staging configure deploy

This list has been left in CONAN_TODO for you to peruse at your leisure.
